putting this here for now 

-will need mysql and xampp atm
and currently you have to set up all tables first running like
source path; in mysql terminal or in workbench --> will look to find a way around tht


download xampp 
start running apache
mysql will need to be configured to run on port 3307. Click on the conif for mysql and update anywhere it says 3306 to 3307 then save
start running mysql
note mysql may fail if you have skype downloaded on your machine

create a database in mysql with port 3307 and name it test

to run the react app navigate to the flightSystem directory then run npm i
then run npm start

to run the backend multiple packages will need to be installed.
please contact Ayo to learn more about these packages.
